# GifTastic

* **Created:** Saturday, March 17th, 2018

* **Context:** This is the sixth week's homework assignment as a part of the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, we are constructing an app using the Giphy API using a combination of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. The primary focus of the assignment is an understanding of APIs to source content from an external provider.  The homework's high level instructions are as follows:

```
In this assignment, you'll use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. To finish this task, you must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
